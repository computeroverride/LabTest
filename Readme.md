  # Images (Explanation)
  You can display an image by adding `!` and wrapping the alt text in `[ ]`.  
  Alt text is a short text description of the image.  
  Then wrap the image link inside `( )`.

  Example:
  ![Screenshot of a comment on a GitHub issue showing an image, added in the Markdown, of an Octocat smiling and raising a tentacle.](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)


  ```python
  def hello():
      print("ET0735 Lab 1")
    ```
